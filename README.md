# pig-game

Pig is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a die as many times as they wish, adding all the rolls to a running total but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. The first player to a predetermined total wins. In two-dice pig, rolling two 1's resets that player's score, but rolling doubles adds twice as many points to the running total.
